# ðŸ§ª Regression Testing Bot

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
Developed an end-to-end regression testing suite using Playwright with TypeScript to automate UI and API test flows across critical login functionalities. Integrated visual regression testing and layout diffing with snapshot baselines. Configured GitHub Actions CI for headless browser execution and continuous testing feedback. Implemented screenshot-on-failure and video logging. Enhanced test pipeline with AI-based failure classification script (flaky/environmental/real bug). All tests run in CI with a custom badge and visual reports.

An advanced Playwright-based regression testing suite with:

- âœ… API Testing (Valid/Invalid Login)
- âœ… UI Testing with Visual Regression
- âœ… Screenshot & Layout Regression
- âœ… GitHub Actions CI Integration
- âœ… AI-Powered Test Failure Classification (planned)

Built for high-confidence releases using modern QA workflows.
